In 2025, my role and contributions changed significantly compared to 2024. I transitioned to a completely new project in the banking domain and became billable for Fiserv under the FSAMS team. I took ownership of understanding the application workflows and began contributing as a PL/SQL developer, handling analysis, debugging, and enhancements more independently than before.

Additionally, I expanded my skillset by learning Oracle APEX and actively delivering tasks involving both PL/SQL and APEX components. My contributions this year focused on real project delivery, client support, and meeting sprint commitments—moving beyond last year’s training-focused responsibilities. Overall, I demonstrated stronger technical depth, accountability, and the ability to contribute directly to client deliverables.
